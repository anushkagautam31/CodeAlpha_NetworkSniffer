# CodeAlpha_NetworkSniffer

🔍 Project Title: Basic Network Sniffer

📁 Domain: Cyber Security

👩‍💻 Intern Name: Anushka Gautam

🧠 About the Project:
This is a beginner-level network packet sniffer built using Python and Scapy. It captures real-time network traffic and displays the source IP, destination IP, protocol type (TCP/UDP/ICMP), and the timestamp of each packet.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used:
- Python
- Scapy library
- Windows OS (with Npcap installed)
- IDLE (Python environment)

🎯 Features:
- Captures 10 real-time packets from the network
- Displays:
  - Source IP
  - Destination IP
  - Protocol type (TCP, UDP, etc.)
  - Timestamp of packet
- Beginner-friendly and lightweight script

🖥️ Sample Output:
```
[2025-07-20 14:53:52] 3.233.158.25 → 192.168.1.5 | Protocol: TCP
```

📚 What I Learned:
- How packet sniffing works
- IP addressing and protocols
- Using Scapy in Python
- Understanding real network traffic

💾 How to Run:
1. Make sure Python and `scapy` are installed.
2. Install **Npcap** from https://nmap.org/npcap/
3. Run the Python script using IDLE or terminal.
4. Watch live network traffic in your terminal!
